<h1>The Best Movies According to Vlad</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Silent Hill</h3>
<p>Deep story about a sinful town wiped off from all maps. First horror I ever watched.</p>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>Good old anime. Interestin plot twist and cool main character.</p>
<h3>Solo leveling</h3>
<p>Another cool anime that has super cool visual batlle effects as well as nice main character with morals I can relate to. </p>
<h3>Split</h3>
<p>psycological thriller about man with multiple personalities and 3 girls that he chose as victims for his sacrifice ritual.</p>
<h3>Incident in a Ghost land</h3>
<p>Another horror that I will remember forever, story telling and acting sent cold shivers through my spine while I was watching.</p>
