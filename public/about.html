<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Who i am and what I do for living</h2>
<p>Vladimirs Cucukins (prefered to be called Vlad), Male , 
  26 Years old , Latvian ( russian speaking) living in UK. Very passionate about things I do. Currently working at Bespak 
(inhalers and other drug delivery devices manufacturing company) started in Dec 2019.
Had always been vigilant and focused on work I do and often was taking extra tasks 
not only to help improve our Overal Euqipment Eficiency but as well as learn something new. 
As an example my routine job requires me to carry out in process checks for production , 
run assembly line and perform Planned Perventative maintenance tasks asigned to MSO 
(Multi Skilled Operator), but i was helping engineers with setting up assembly lines throughout 
HMI (human machine interface) to improve our production same as was helping to update 
Vision system on one of our Printing machines(uninstalling old vision system cameras and pc , installing new ones 
setting up cameras throughout special software) to increase amount of goodware from the 
machine and update the hardware as it was getting outdated.

<h2>My hobbies and what motivates me</h2>
<p>I think its important to mention what generally keeps me going and what I 
usually like to do when im free. Unfortunately working at the current place of work 
my life balance is kinda a little off (working 24/5 shift rotation earlies/nights/lates
first week 06.00 till 14.30 , next week 22.00 till 06.30 and week after 14.00 till 22.30).
Yet I still get quite a lot of time to learn new things. Due to work specifics I started 
to learn quite a bit about assembly machines, software and hardware. As well as for a while 
my wife had good old Ford Focus 1.6 petrol , cheep and cheerful car but unfortunately this car 
was breaking a little too often. Fortunately for me I was able to get some 'hands on' experience
and started to learn a little more about cars and generally about engineering. Other from 
such complicated hobbies I do enjoy watching thrillers/horrors and comedies ( majority of the time comedies right after 
watching thrillers and horrors LOL ) check out <a href="./public/movie-ranking.html">My Top 5 movies</a>. I do love to listen to music and sing and trust me you wouldn't 
want to hear me sing. Have two little black cats that we love and admire as well as spend a lot of time with them.
Another thing I love to do is going for car rides. Long or short journeys , I just love driving a car. Oh and of course 
I do love spending time by PC YouTube , gaming , learning.

<h2>What im hopping to achieve </h2>
<p>Well as for career... I'm hoping to succeed in web developing path maybe look into other things like 
creating apps maybe... generally speaking I want to progress. Would it be a career ladder/financial situation
or anything else , I want to learn new skills and grow higher. That usually keeps me going and that is partly a reason why 
i don't want to spend much longer in place im working now as the path I chose to progress to requires me to 
attend college to get sertificates. which at my current life situation would mean to take a pay cut to learn 
and I can't put pressure on my wife for 2-3 years to get to where I want to be for her to carry a lot of bills 
Car payments , insurance , mortgage and etc. So i thought I will get my skills to a good level 
in a different job role that possibly will improve my financial situation better then going 2-3 years college and 
getting a pay cut and all that without any risks in the way as I study web development before and after my full-time 
job when I have a bit of spare time.
